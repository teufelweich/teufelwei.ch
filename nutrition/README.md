-  most significant barriers to vegetarianism and veganism: concerns about preferred taste, nutritional deficiencies, and convenience

**Main reasons for vegetarism:**

-  Ethics-related reasons
	-  animal welfare
	-  sustainability (concerns regarding climate change)

- Health-related reasons
	- primary reason for vegetarism (not necessarily for veganism)

**Main reasons against vegetarianism/veganism:**

- Health-related barriers
	-  many non-vegetarians believe that abstention from animal products leads to nutritional deficiencies

- Taste preferences
	- personal cravings
	-  inconvenience because many products are less familiar to most consumers

- Social barriers
	-  influence of family and friends
	-  “It is significantly more difficult for would-be vegetarians who are primarily around other non-vegetarians to deviate from their social norms, simply because it is hard for any person to be different.”

**Main influence for children:**

 >"The single most important barrier to vegetarianism among children and young adults is parents."

**Sofo Archon – Most common anti-vegan arguments**

[https://sofoarchon.com/anti-vegan-arguments/](https://sofoarchon.com/anti-vegan-arguments/)

(from one guy’s personal experience, including his own replies to those arguments)

+ my own ideas to reply to this

over 50 billion land animals and about one trillion marine animals are killed each year by humans to turn them into food and derive pleasure from consuming them

_[1] German numbers_

1. Eating animals is instictual.
	- doing something because it appears to be instinctual doesn’t automatically make it right (e.g., murder or physical violence against other people could also be argued to be instinctual)
	- humans are omnivores not carnivores
	-  the industrial way we are producing meat and other animal products has nothing to do with the need of stone age people to hunt to stay alive
	- 
2. We have canine teeth to each meat.
	-  Our jaw, skeleton, muscles and digestive system are much more like those of herbivores than those of carnivores
	-  (also: huge canine teeth does not mean that the body is designed to eat meat: for example hippos have the largest teeth in animal kingdom, but they are herbivores)
	-  Would humans be able to kill, open up and eat a living animal uncooked by just using their teeth?

3. Eating meat helped us develop large brains.
	- Are obligate carnivores the most intelligent animals on the planet?
		- Not sure, but let’s assume it is true. Should we keep eating it?
		- From a scientific perspective: definitely not (research showed again and again that eating meat is detrimental to our health)

4. We’ve always been eating animals.
	- False: our physiology developed since the Miocene (20 Million Years ago) where we ate plants exclusively
		- only since the Paleolithic (2 Million Years ago) we started to use tools
	- doing something wrong for a long time doesn’t mean that we should continue doing it (example: people killing each other in all of human history. Is it a good thing then?)

5. Animals eat other animals.
	- Humans are not obligate carnivores (don’t HAVE to eat meat) à silly to compare us to animals that can ONLY digest meat
	- Just because animals do something, doesn’t mean we have to adopt it (e.g., kill other people, smell each others butts when we meet, …)
	- predators have an important role in the food chain, and thus are needed to preserve ecosystems à how we are producing animals for their meat and other products has nothing in common with a food chain and is harmful for many ecosystems

6. Vegans aren’t healthy.
	- Several studies showed that this is nothing but a myth
	- In fact, vegans are generally healthier than non-vegans
	- Also studies that show evidence to the contrary, but nearly all of them were funded by the meat, dairy and egg industries à intentionally bad design to manipulate their results
	- there are several problems with the value of the results of studies in nutritional sciences
		- methodology is a key factor
		- several studies need to be evaluated simultaneously à results that show the same trend in all studies can be seen as relatively significant

7. Vegans kill plants.
	- Ethical argument against veganism
		- But: by eating animals, we are actually harming many times more plants than by eating plants directly (depending on the animal in question, it takes 3-20 pounds of vegetable protein to produce just one pound of animal protein)
	- Vegans kill far fewer plants than meat eaters

8. Killing animals humanely is ok.
	- There is no humane way to kill someone, especially if it doesn’t serve the purpose to survive or to live in good health
	- “if an animal had a good life before it was murdered, and its murder was executed as fast and painlessly as possible, then there’s nothing wrong with that at all” à comparable to “raping another human is ok, if you treated them well first”
	-  “it is okay, if I know, where the meat is coming from” à in the U.S. 99 % of all animals are in factory farms _([2] source and explanation of factory farms)_

9. Eating dairy or eggs doesn’t harm animals.
	- Dairy and egg industries are as cruel as meat industry
	- Dairy industry:
		- _Why do you think cows produce milk?_
		- Not all the time, as many people think. Just around the time they give birth to feed their babies.
		- In order for dairy products to be sold, female cows are regularly inseminated by hand to get pregnant and produce milk (about once a year). The moment they give birth, their babies are immediately stolen from them. Male calves are killed and sold as veal, while female calves are raised to suffer the same future as their mothers.
		- As soon, as their milk production decreases (average after 5 years), they are killed, and their meat is sold (meat of dairy cows is often sold to fast food chains as it is of lower quality).
	- Egg industry:
		-  Male chicks are considered worthless and unprofitable by the industry
		- Female chicks get their eggs stolen constantly, which makes them produce more of them without end (naturally they would stop producing eggs when their nest is full)
		- Immensely tiresome and unhealthy for hens (some of them even die in the process)
		- Once their egg production wanes (after about 18 to 24 months), they are killed and their meat is sold.

10. If we didn’t breed animals, they wouldn’t have a life.
	- Bringing an animal to life just to exploit, abuse and kill it, does not make it ethical.
	-  We need to think about what happens to all the animals that are alive already if everyone turned vegan one day to another. But the world’s population won’t turn vegan overnight. Rather, it will gradually transition to eating a plant-based diet over the course of decades or even centuries. à less demand for animal products à less animals will be bred into existence

11. If we didn’t eat animals, they would overpopulate the planet and starve to death.
	- “_If we didn’t slaughter animals to eat them, they would suffer and die_.”
	-  World’s population won’t turn vegan overnight. Rather, it will gradually transition to eating a plant-based diet over the course of decades or even centuries. à less demand for animal products à less animals will be bred into existence

12. Meat is tasty.
	- Momentary taste-pleasure shouldn’t be more important than the life of another animal
		- Unnecessary exploitation, torture and murder of animals
	- at the moment, we are not asking the people to stop eating meat altogether, but first we try to make them reduce (at least for lunch in the Mensa)

13. Vegan food is expensive.
	- Depends on the kind of vegan food
	- Processed vegan foods (such as meat substitutes) can be expensive
	- Vegan foods such as grains, legumes, seasonal, locally grown fruits and vegetables à diet will most likely be cheaper than a diet that includes animal products
		- Study of Oxford University (The Lancet Planetary Health) [3]
	-  almost every day the vegan option is the cheapest one in the Mensa (1,95 € for students, 3,85 € for employees)

14. You can’t be perfect vegan.
	- Can’t completely avoid using things that either were partly made using animal products or have animal exploitation involved in their production (e.g., industrial glue)
	- No reason for not doing as much as you can. (If the world cannot be 100 % violent-free, we should still care about the immense violence that exists in society)
	- Veganism, by definition, is not about eliminating suffering, but about reducing it as much as practically possible.

15. It is my personal choice.
	- Personal freedom stops when you start to affect the lives/freedom of others: animals by killing them and other people by contributing to the climate crisis.

16. One person can’t make a difference.
	- It is true, that one person’s choice will not save the climate. In terms of animal cruelty, every reduction makes a difference.
	- But most important: We are talking about a large kitchen which is supplying thousands of people with lunch every day. It is a substantial change in terms of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, animal welfare and your own personal health.
	- the influence a change in Mensa food can have on their customers or people around them can even amplify this effect.

What is a factory farm?

Factory farming is a system specifically designed to maximize the production of meat, eggs, and dairy at the lowest cost possible. These farms intensively confine large numbers of animals in small spaces such as cages or crates. Most spend their entire lives inside a shed and never feel the sunlight or breathe fresh air.

Factory farms –also called Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)– have at least 125,000 chickens raised for meat, 82,000 hens used for eggs, 2,500 pigs, 1,000 cows raised for meat, or 700 cows used for dairy.

-  Compared with the cost of current diets, the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns were, depending on the pattern, up to 22–34% lower in cost in upper-middle-income to high-income countries on average
	- Countries: US, UK, Australia, western Europe
- diet-related costs of climate change and health care increased the affordability of the dietary patterns in future projections
- Variants of vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns were generally most affordable, and pescatarian diets were least affordable.
-  In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, dietary change interventions that incentivise adoption of healthy and sustainable diets can help consumers in those countries reduce costs while, at the same time, contribute to fulfilling national climate change commitments and reduce public health spending. In low-income and lower-middle-income countries, healthy and sustainable diets are substantially less costly than western diets and can also be cost-competitive in the medium-to-long term, subject to beneficial socioeconomic development and reductions in food waste.

**Pros and Cons of being a vegetarian**
![[Pasted image 20230524111741.png]]

- **Vegetarianism Pros:**
	-  Weight loss
	-   lowered risk of chronic disease (lower cholesterol, prevent diabetes, prevent heart disease, lower risk of certain cancers by improving nutrition)
	-  positive environmental and ethical impact
	-   lower grocery costs

-  **Vegetarianism Cons:**
	-   lack of certain nutrients
		-  diets can be lower in protein and calcium intake à make up for this by incorporating new products into your diets
		-  Try new recipes (e.g., Planetary Health Diet recipes at the provided QR-Code)
	-   lack of choice and convenience
		-  Mensa is as convenient as it gets
		-  The more people buy vegetarian/vegan dishes, the more choice will be there.
		-  Also: People can take part in our questionnaire and affect the food in Mensa.
	-  difficulties adopting a new “lifestyle”
		-  For now, we just ask you to stop consuming meat in Mensa for lunch (not too much of a lifestyle change). You can see, how it goes from there.

Other arguments:
	-  Many traditional recipes need meat.
		-  Try new dishes, there are many ideas on the internet.
		-  Often it won’t work to just replace the meat by some meat substitute.
		-  But easy to try vegetarian/vegan dishes in Mensa. The more people buy those dishes, the more options will be there in future.
	-  Food without meat does not taste as good.
		-  People often say this without having tried different vegetarian/vegan options. There will always be dishes you like and dishes you don’t like.
		-  Ask them, what their argument is based on and then see if they actually tried the different Mensa dishes.

- Rainforest is destroyed to produce Soy.
	-  Almost 80 % of the world's soybean crop is fed to livestock, especially for beef, chicken, egg, and dairy products. (according to WWF [https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/food_practice/sustainable_production/soy/](https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/food_practice/sustainable_production/soy/))
	-  Harder to match minimum protein requirements
		-  See table on the next page for some plant-based protein sources

A good strategy in talking to people, who are upset about vegetarianism/veganism is to ask them, what their arguments are based on. That way you get them into a conversation and make them think about thoughts. I experienced many people who shouted a generic argument at me, but never even thought about its credibility. It will also make it easier to debunk their pro-meat arguments, because you can detect the flaws in their explanation.
